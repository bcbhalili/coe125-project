Project Title: Sign Language Analyzer using OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Python Programming Language
Project Description:
  This project analyzes the user's hand gesture provided in a specific sensing area. The project is only limited to the following: the user can only use his/her left hand for analysis. Else it will produce unexpected results. Another limitation is that the project scopes only from letters A to Z instead of numbers.
